# GitDash 

> Maintain peak productivity by knowing exactly what you need to work on and when you need to work on it. 

## Introduction

As software developers, we have often started new projects and then we forgot about it. This mostly happens because we don't track what items we are working on and what the deadline is. We might track a single repo and all the issues on it but what if we had one place which would track all of our issues and send us reminders when we don't work a specific deadline irrespective of what the repository may be. Presenting to you, GitDash...

![homepage](images/homepage.PNG?raw=True)

## üéØ Features 

- Get all the repos, issues and pull requests you are working on. 
- Star the repositories that you are working on immediately to get their information ASAP 
- Create your profile with the details from your GitHub account and stand out from the crowd. 
- Get notifications of the what you are working on, when you are working on it.

#### Dashboard Preview 

In this section, you can see the dashboard of your profile and the details that would appear as soon as you log in. This is for quick access to the things that are most important to you.

## üìñ Documentation Details

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## ‚ö° Installation
### Client side
First install the dependencies for the project:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Server side
#### Pre-requisites
Please ensure you have:
- [.NET sdk](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

In order for favourites feature to work you must run the server api.

First install the dependencies for the project:
```bash
cd server
dotnet build
```

Then, run the development server:
```bash
cd server/api
dotnet run
```

### GitHub Authentication

To get the GitHub authentication to work, you need to create a `.env` file in the `client` directory with the following content

```bash
GITHUB_ID=<your_github_client_id>
GITHUB_SECRET=<your_github_client_secret>
AUTH_SECRET=<your_auth_secret>
JWT_SECRET=<your_auth_secret>
```

Follow the guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app) to create a new GitHub OAuth app.

The details should look something like this:

![OAuth App Details](images/githubAuth.png?raw=True)

On creating the OAuth app on GitHub, you need to set the `GITHUB_ID` in the `.env` file as the Client ID you see in the GitHub OAuth App in your account, and the `GITHUB_SECRET` to the Client Secret that you generate. Refer to the image below for more details

![GitHub OAuth App Creds](images/githubClient.png?raw=True)

After adding the GITHUB_ID and GITHUB_SECRET to your `.env` create two more values called `AUTH_SECRET` and `JWT_SECRET` which you can generate yourself as any 
string which will be used to authenticate with Github.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.tsx`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

### Server side and Cockroach Cloud Setup
To set up cockroachDb cloud follow instructions [here](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-started-cockroachdb/)
To connect to cockroachDb, edit the connection stringsd in the `appsettings.Development.json` file in the `server/api` directory with the following content:
```bash
...
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server={host}; Port={port}; User Id={user}; Password={password}; Database={cluster.database}; SSL Mode=Require; Root Certificate={certificate location}; Trust Server Certificate=true"
...
```
Where:
 - `{host}` is your host name 
 - `{port}` is your port number
 - `{user}` is your user to connect to cockroachDB 
 - `{password}` is your password to connect to cockroachDB 
 - `{cluster}` is your cluster name 
 - `{certificate location}` is the directory location to your certificate (Cloud cockroachDB requires SSL)


## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## :rocket: Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## :wrench: Tech Stack

- Next.js 
- Cockroach DB Cloud 
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI
- Octokit Core.js
- .Net
- Entity Framework Core
<!-- - Linode -->


<!-- ## Useful commands

Switch branches:
```
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Make new branch and switch to it:
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

I'd recommend using the GitHub CLI for reviewing Pull Requests, making Pull Requests and making Issues.

Download it with Homebrew:
```
brew install gh
``` -->
